To start, they listened to several songs until they found one that was catchy and they really liked. After picking out the catchy song, they did three things: they looked up the lyrics to understand the words, they looked up the chords to know how to play the music, and they listened to the song several times to get familiar with its tune and rhythm. Once they had the lyrics and chords, and knew the song well, they practiced singing the song over and over. After lots of practice, they were finally able to learn the new song to sing. By adhering to the provided temporal information, the desired goal is achieved."
