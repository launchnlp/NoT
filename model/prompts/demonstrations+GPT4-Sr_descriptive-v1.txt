After making this decision, they listened to several songs until they found one that was catchy and they really liked. Once they picked out the catchy song, they did three things: they looked up the lyrics to understand the words, they looked up the chords to know how to play the music, and they listened to the song several times to get familiar with its tune and rhythm. After gathering all this information, they practiced singing the song, combining the lyrics, chords, and melody they learned. Finally, after practicing, they were able to learn the new song to sing. By adhering to the provided temporal information, the desired goal is achieved."
